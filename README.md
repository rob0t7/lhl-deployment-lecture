# lhl-deployment-lecture

Today we cover what happens when your app goes into production. 
We started with all the components being on the same physical machine.
Later we add redundancy and scalability. 

To make the app even faster we introduced worker queues, background jobs,
CDN, edge caching, fragmentation caching, low level caching.

Finally we need to make sure everything is always up so the topic of monitoring
was introduced.
